Whenever, we're not together,
in days of sunshine, or stormy weather,
                         Fm   F  Fm  F..Fm
don't you feel me loving you..u...u......

When the sun lights, when the moon lights,
In the dark night, when the time's right,
                         Fm   F  Fm  F..Fm
don't you feel me loving you..u...u......

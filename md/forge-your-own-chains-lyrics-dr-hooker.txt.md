C#m  F#  Hmi E               C#m   F# Hm E
Can’t dig        what you’re doin’
C#m     F#       Hm E        C#m F# Hm E
I won’t know you      pretty soon
C#m    E        F#         G G#
Got to try to improve your brain
   C#m       E         F#    G    G#  C#m   F# Hm
To see. It’s clear you forge your own chains
E              C#m    F# Hm E
Forge your own chains

Maybe one more cigarette to clear your head
Today you’re living; tomorrow you’re dead
Consequences aren’t always the same
A link… I think… You forge your own chains
Forge your own chains

You’re thinking the hard stuff ain’t so bad
Stick with it and believe me you’ll wind up sad
Stop it now. Don’t do it again
You see, it’s clear you forge your own chains
Forge your own chains

Drown you sorrows in a drink
Don’t hurt anyone. That’s what you think
Your reason and your mind are getting mighty lame
I know you know you forge your own chains
Forge your own chains
Forge your own chains
Forge your own chains
Forge your own…

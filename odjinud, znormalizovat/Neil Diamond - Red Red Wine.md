           G C D
Red red wine,
           G  C  D
Go to my head,
                  G  C  D
Make me forget that I
           G  C  D
Still need her so,
            G  C  D
Red red wine,
           G  C  D 
It's up to you,
              G  C  D
All I can do I've done,
                 G C D
But memories won't go,
     D             C D   
No, memories won't go..

I have sworn,
            G
That with time,
            C                 G
Thoughts of you would leave my head,
        D          G
I was wrong and I find,
           C                 D
Just one thing makes me forget...


[Hook]
      G C D  
Red red wine,
               G C D
Stay close to me,
                G C D
Don't let me be alone,
                G C D
It's tearing apart
   D              C D
My blue, blue heart.

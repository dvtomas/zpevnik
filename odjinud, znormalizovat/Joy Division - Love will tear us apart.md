[Intro]
D   D Dsus4 D Dmaj9 Bm Bm  Em    A

[Verse 1]
D                D Dsus4 D Dmaj9
When the routine bites hard
Bm                 A
And ambitions are low
D                Dsus4
And the resentment rides high
Bm                   A
But emotions wont grow
D                  Dsus4
And were changin our ways,
Bm                  A
Takin different roads

[Chorus]
Em    D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
Then love, love will tear us apart again

[Verse 2]
D                Dsus4
Why is the bedroom so cold
Bm                   A
Turned away on your side?
D                Dsus4
Is my timing that flawed
Bm                   A
Our respect run so dry?
D                Dsus4
Yet theres still this appeal
Bm                   A
That weve kept through our lives

[Chorus]
Em    D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
Love, love will tear us apart again

[Verse 3]
D                Dsus4
Do you cry out in your sleep
Bm                   A
All my failings expose?
D                Dsus4
Get a taste in my mouth
Bm                   A
As desperation takes hold
D                Dsus4
Is it somethin  so good
Bm                   A
Just cant function no more?

[Chorus]
Em    D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
When love, love will tear us apart again
